TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_200m is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_200m and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_200m] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_1 and clk_200m are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_1] -to [get_clocks clk_200m]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_200m and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_200m] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_200m is created on an inappropriate internal pin i_system_wrapper/system_i/FFT_Top_0/inst/i_clk. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 1129 control sets (vs. available limit of 13300, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -quiet -hier *reset_sync_in_reg*/PRE -filter {NAME =~ *i_reset_manager*}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '145' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
